# Distracted-Drivers

According to the CDC motor vehicle safety divison, one in five car accidents are caused by a distracted driver. We have all heard this in many statefarm commericals but the question is if there is a way to classify a drivers behavior. Statefarm has sponsored a Kaggle competition to improve some worrying statistics provided by the CDC. This project will involve building a convulutional neural network using the functional API that will provide categorical image classification for distracted drivers. The network will build with categorical classification because I don't just want to know if the driver is distracted but what class of distraction they belong to (cell phone in hand, looking behind, hands off the wheel). Below I used Professor Sorauf's fit hack for convenience.
